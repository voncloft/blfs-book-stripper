# blfs-book-stripper
To be used with scratchpkg in my repo (I forked it, it is not mine)
This creates spkgbuilds


just run getbook

Added 32 bit flag

This works for most packages - however it is always a good idea to double check...I am not responsible for any mishaps to your system

I offer no support, everything is on YOU!!


run example

64 bit:
page-stripper libdrm

32 bit:
page-stripper libdrm -32
